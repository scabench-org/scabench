      "title": "Unchecked calldata length causes underflow and out-of-bounds slice in removeSelector",
      "description": "The removeSelector function subtracts 4 from the provided bytes length in inline assembly without verifying that data.length >= 4. In inline assembly, arithmetic is unchecked; if data.length < 4 (e.g., empty or short calldata to a fallback/receive), params.length underflows to a very large value and params.offset is advanced by 4. This produces a bytes calldata slice that extends far beyond the actual calldata. Using this slice (e.g., reading params.length, copying to memory, or abi.decode) can cause denial of service via excessive memory allocation/out-of-gas and may bypass ABI input-length checks, leading to mis-decoding with zero-padded values. This occurs in removeSelector()'s assembly block where params.length := sub(data.length, 4) and params.offset := add(data.offset, 4) are set without bounds checks.",

      "description": "In _handleVerifySignature, the nonce is consumed via _useNonce(signedBatchedCall.nonce) before the signature is verified. Because execute(SignedBatchedCall, bytes) is publicly callable, any external caller can submit arbitrary data to this function and cause nonces to be marked as used even when the signature is invalid (the call later reverts with InvalidSignature). If the NonceManager enforces sequential or otherwise predictable nonces, an attacker can pre-consume expected nonces (e.g., 0,1,2,...) and deny legitimate transactions from being executed, or invalidate pre-signed messages. Even if nonces are not strictly sequential, an attacker can still grief by burning arbitrary nonces. This is a denial-of-service via nonce misuse.\n\nWhere: MinimalDelegation._handleVerifySignature() (first statement), called from execute(SignedBatchedCall, bytes).\n\nWhy it's a security issue: Nonces are intended to prevent replay for authorized operations. Consuming the nonce before verifying authorization lets unauthorized callers invalidate nonces.\n\nPotential impact: Denial of service against legitimate signers by blocking expected nonces or invalidating pre-signed operations. Severity depends on the NonceManager design (sequential vs. arbitrary nonces) but can fully brick the \"signed execute\" flow if sequential nonces are used.",

If this is used to represent an 'allowance', it becomes a single, contract-wide allowance per spender rather than per (owner, spender). Because transient storage persists across all calls to the same contract within a transaction, a value set for one context/owner can be observed and consumed in another.

This occurs in isAdmin(Settings) at lines 21-24 (specifically _isAdmin := shr(200, settings)). This is a security issue because any code that relies on SettingsLib.isAdmin for access control can be bypassed if an attacker can set or influence the top 6 bytes of the Settings value (e.g., by providing or constructing a Settings with bits set above bit 207).
