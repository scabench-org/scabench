      "description": "In swapIn32502CA71 and swapInPermit2CEAAB576, the code enforces the minimum-out constraint by comparing a signed value to int256(minOut): require(-swapAmountOut >= int256(minOut), ...). Casting an arbitrary uint256 to int256 is unsafe: values > 2^255 - 1 wrap into negative int256 values. If a caller supplies minOut >= 2^255, int256(minOut) becomes negative, making the comparison trivially true for any non-negative -swapAmountOut, effectively disabling the minOut protection. This undermines slippage protection and can result in users receiving less output than intended without a revert. Impact: loss of funds for callers relying on the minOut check.",

      "description": "The contract does not clear per-token approvals when an NFT is transferred. In ERC721, getApproved[tokenId] must be cleared on every transfer to prevent previously approved operators from retaining control after ownership changes. Here, _transfer() calls SEAWATER.transferPositionEEC7A3CD without resetting getApproved[_tokenId], and neither transferFrom nor safeTransferFrom clear approvals. As a result, an address approved by the previous owner remains approved after the token moves to a new owner and can immediately call transferFrom using the lingering approval to move the NFT without the new owner's consent. This can lead to loss of NFTs for recipients who are unaware of stale approvals.\n- Where: _transfer() (invoked by transferFrom and safeTransferFrom) does not clear getApproved[_tokenId]. No other function clears it.\n- Why it's a security issue: Violates ERC721 standard safety and allows unauthorized transfers after ownership changes.\n- Potential impact: Theft/loss of NFTs by previously approved operators after a sale/transfer.",

Specifically, it executes require(data != IERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector, \"bad nft transfer received data\"); which is the inverse of the ERC721 requirement (it should require equality). This causes:\n- Safe transfers to ERC721-compliant contracts to revert (DoS against correct receivers).\n- Safe transfers to non-compliant contracts to succeed, potentially locking NFTs in contracts that cannot move them out.\n- Where: _onTransferReceived() function.\n- Why it's a security issue: Breaks the safety guarantees of safeTransferFrom, enabling asset lock-up and preventing interaction with compliant contracts.\n- Potential impact: Denial of service to compliant receivers; NFTs stuck in non-receiver contracts; user asset loss due to irretrievable NFTs.",
