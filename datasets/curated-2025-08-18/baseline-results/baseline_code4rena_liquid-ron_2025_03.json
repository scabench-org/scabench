      "description": "In _depositRONTo(), the contract calls IWRON(wron).transfer(to, amount) and does not check a return value or otherwise ensure the transfer succeeded. Many ERC-20 tokens signal failure by returning false rather than reverting. Because the interface declares no return value, a false return will be ignored, and execution will continue as if successful. Location: _depositRONTo() in RonHelper. Impact: If WRON (or a non-standard implementation) returns false on transfer instead of reverting, the WRON minted by deposit() will remain in the contract rather than being delivered to the intended recipient, potentially resulting in user funds being stuck under the contract\u2019s custody with no automatic rollback. This can lead to loss of funds for users and inconsistent accounting.",

RonHelper does not implement a receive() or payable fallback, so unless a derived contract provides a payable receive/fallback, WRON.withdraw will revert when attempting to transfer RON to this contract. Location: _withdrawRONTo() in RonHelper. Impact: Any function relying on _withdrawRONTo() will revert, creating a denial of service for withdrawals and potentially locking users\u2019 WRON until the issue is addressed in the inheriting contract.",

      "title": "Broken onlyOperator modifier blocks operators and can brick critical operations",
      "description": "The onlyOperator modifier is logically inverted: it reverts when msg.sender is not the owner OR when the sender is marked as an operator. As written, only the owner AND not marked as an operator can call functions guarded by onlyOperator. This prevents any designated operator from executing operational functions, and if the owner is ever marked as an operator, all onlyOperator functions become permanently inaccessible until the mapping is corrected. Where: modifier onlyOperator() near the top of the contract; affects functions harvest(uint256,address[]), harvestAndDelegateRewards(uint256,address[],address), delegateAmount(uint256,uint256[],address[]), redelegateAmount(uint256,uint256[],address[],address[]), undelegateAmount(uint256,uint256[],address[]), and finaliseRonRewardsForEpoch(). Why it's a security issue: It constitutes a broken access control that can cause denial of service of core management and withdrawal-finalization flows. Potential impact: Operators cannot harvest or manage delegation, and more critically, users\u2019 epoch-based withdrawal requests cannot be finalized (finaliseRonRewardsForEpoch), leaving withdrawals stuck until the owner fixes operator mapping; if the owner mistakenly sets operator[owner] = true, even the owner is blocked from performing these critical operations.",

      "description": "The receive() payable function replicates deposit behavior (wraps incoming RON and calls Escrow.deposit) but lacks the whenNotPaused guard present on the public deposit() payable function. As a result, users can still deposit by sending RON directly to the contract address even when the contract is paused. Where: receive() external payable at the end of the contract. Why it's a security issue: Pausable is typically an emergency control to halt state-changing operations such as deposits. Allowing deposits via the fallback undermines that control and can lead to continued inflows during emergencies or incidents. Potential impact: Bypass of pause leading to continued deposits/minting while the system is intended to be halted; depending on Escrow implementation, this could mint/balance-update despite pause and complicate incident response.",

This results in N calls with the same full array when _consensusAddrs has length N. Where: harvest() function, the for-loop calling claimRewards with the entire array each iteration (around lines 26-34). Why it's a security issue: If the underlying Ronin staking contract prevents double-claiming within a block/epoch, subsequent calls may revert, causing the whole harvest() to fail (DoS on harvesting). If it does not revert but performs heavy processing each time, it unnecessarily increases gas usage and could hit block gas limits for larger arrays, again leading to DoS. In the worst case, if the external contract has an accounting flaw and allows repeated claims, this could over-withdraw rewards. Potential impact: Denial of service of the harvest process, wasted gas, and depending on external contract semantics, potential protocol-level accounting inconsistencies or overclaim.",

Why it's a security issue: address(this).balance includes any ether/RON previously or externally sent to the proxy (e.g., pre-funding for delegation or third-party transfers via the open receive()). This can inflate the reported claimedAmount unrelated to actual staking rewards, potentially corrupting vault reward accounting if the vault relies on the returned value. An attacker or any third party can send funds to the proxy just before harvest; the function will sweep and report them as \u201cclaimed.\u201d Potential impact: Data/accounting corruption in the vault (misattributing deposits as staking rewards), misleading yield metrics, and potential misallocation of shares/rewards within the vault.",
