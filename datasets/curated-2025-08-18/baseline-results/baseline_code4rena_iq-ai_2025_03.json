      "description": "The factory owner can arbitrarily set the raw creation bytecode used for deploying Agent, Governor, and LiquidityManager via create2. Specifically, setGovenerBytecode(), setAgentBytecode(), and setLiquidityManagerBytecode() allow the owner to replace the creation code at any time. createAgent() then deploys these components using that bytecode (deployAgent, deployGovernor, deployLiquidityManager). This enables deploying malicious contracts (e.g., a LiquidityManager/bootstrapPool that siphons the user's _amountToBuy tokens during buy(), or an Agent/Governor that grants the owner backdoors or drains token supplies). Because createAgent transfers user funds (creationFee and potentially _amountToBuy) before or around these deployments and subsequently interacts with the newly deployed contracts, a malicious bytecode can directly cause loss of user funds, unauthorized access, or protocol manipulation. Impact: theft of user funds at creation, privilege escalation over agents/tokens, and arbitrary behavior by core components.",

In the existing-pair branch, it performs a ratio check using (currencyAmount * reserveAgentTokens) / reserveCurrency. If reserveCurrency is zero, this division reverts. This can occur if an attacker pre-creates the pair via the factory but leaves it empty (reserves both zero), or if the 'mini mint' transfers zero on one or both sides due to small balances (liquidityAmount/1_000_000 or currencyAmount/1_000_000 rounds to zero). Location: addLiquidityToFraxswap(), in the else branch after the mini-mint, at the condition 'if ((currencyAmount * uint256(reserveAgentTokens)) / uint256(reserveCurrency) > liquidityAmount) { ... }'. Additionally, getMaxSell() divides by (reserveOut + tokenOut); if both are zero it can also revert under similar conditions. Why it's a security issue: A malicious actor can front-run moveLiquidity by creating the pair (with zero liquidity) so getPair() returns a non-zero address, forcing the existing-pair path. If the contract\u2019s balances are small enough that the mini-mint transfers zero on one or both sides, reserveCurrency remains zero and the subsequent division reverts, causing a denial of service. Potential impact: Prevents moveLiquidity from executing (DoS), delaying or blocking the protocol\u2019s transition from the bootstrap pool to Fraxswap until balances become large enough or special handling is added.",
