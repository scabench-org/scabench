      "title": "Unbounded pagination enables expensive full-store scans in queries",
      "description": "The constants DEFAULT_LIMIT and MAX_LIMIT are set to u32::MAX (4294967295) and are used as defaults for pagination in multiple query endpoints. When the caller omits the limit, these queries attempt to iterate and collect up to the entire dataset. This occurs in:\n- operators(): computes limit = limit.unwrap_or(DEFAULT_LIMIT).min(MAX_LIMIT) and iterates self.operators.prefix(...).range(...).take(limit)\n- tokens(): computes limit similarly and iterates self.tokens.idx.owner.keys(...).take(limit)\n- all_tokens(): computes limit similarly and iterates self.tokens.range(...).take(limit)\n- approvals()/owner_of(): not paginated; they return all approvals, which can also grow unbounded\n\nWhy this is a security issue: CosmWasm queries execute in the WASM VM with a query gas/CPU limit. Unbounded iteration and collection can exhaust gas/CPU or memory, causing the query to fail and potentially saturating node resources if abused. Attackers can spam these queries with large or default limits to cause denial of service of the contract's query endpoints. Additionally, if other contracts issue smart queries to these endpoints during transaction execution, those transactions can be made to consistently fail (griefing), impacting protocol integrations.\n\nPotential impact:\n- Denial of service for RPC/query endpoints of this contract (queries time out or run out of gas)\n- Griefing of other contracts that smart-query these endpoints (their transactions may run out of gas)\n- Excessive node resource consumption (CPU/memory) when datasets are large\n\nWhere it occurs:\n- DEFAULT_LIMIT/MAX_LIMIT constants at top of file\n- operators(...) function\n- tokens(...) function\n- all_tokens(...) function\n- approvals(...) and owner_of(...) return all approvals without pagination\n",
